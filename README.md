# API-INTEGRATION-AND-DATA-VISUALIZATION

TASK 1 - API INTEGRATION AND DATA VISUALIZATION

**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME**: Harshal Devidas Thorat

**INTERN ID**: CT6WJEG

**DOMAIN**: Python Programming

**BATCH DURATION**: January 5th, 2025 to February 20th, 2025

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTHOSH

DESCRIPTION OF TASK

1. **API Integration**:
   - **OpenWeatherMap API**: Used to fetch real-time weather data such as temperature and humidity.

2. **Data Handling**:
   - **Python `requests` Library**: Retrieves data from the API in JSON format.
   - **Pandas**: Processes and organizes the JSON data into a structured DataFrame for easy analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Matplotlib**: Creates basic plots and handles the layout of visualizations.
   - **Seaborn**: Enhances plots with aesthetically pleasing and informative statistical graphics.

4. **Date Formatting**:
   - **Matplotlib Dates (`mdates`)**: Manages date and time formatting to ensure clear, non-overlapping x-axis labels.

 Workflow:
- The script sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, retrieves weather data, and processes it into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Data is filtered to include only current and past dates.
- Visualizations are generated using Seaborn and Matplotlib to display temperature and humidity trends, with properly formatted date labels.

This project showcases the integration of API data retrieval with effective visualization, emphasizing clarity and usability.
